calendar_app.py is the script for the app itself and is for developers who want to change the code or do what they want with it

running build.bat makes the calendar_app.exe from the calendar_py.exe, so any changes made to the .py file before running the .bat file will be seen in the calendar_app.exe after running the .bat file

some antiviruses may detect the exe as suspicious so antivirus should be turned off before launching the app
