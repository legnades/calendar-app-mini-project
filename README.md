read windows versions desc before reading this one

if you want to simply use the app or try it out, just download "Qubify-ITs_Prodlendar" and open it.

but if you want to do the installation for whatever reason (for example, changing the .py code) then the instructions are below

# wip installation instructions:

1. -make folder named "calendar-app-ubuntu" in home folder

2. -place build.sh and calendar_app.py in this folder

3. -open terminal and copy this into terminal and press enter: chmod +x ~/calendar-app-ubuntu/build.sh

4. -paste this into terminal and enter: ./calendar-app-ubuntu/build.sh

5. -terminal may ask you to install specific libraries. type in the commands that terminal tells you to

6. -after installing all libraries by typing all commands into terminal, copy the same command from step 4

7. -if there are still libraries left to install, please install them. copy this command into terminal and enter: chmod x+ ~/calendar-app-ubuntu/dist/Qubify-ITs_Prodlendar
   
8. lastly, copy and enter this into terminal: ./calendar-app-ubuntu/dist/Qubify-ITs_Prodlendar

app should open if you are lucky lol
